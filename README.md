### Planning-and-Development-Code-Violations-Scottsdale

The City of Scottsdale publishes a [dataset](http://data.scottsdaleaz.gov/dataset/planning-and-development-code-violations)* that includes closed planning and development cases for one rolling year, updated weekly.  Of particular interest to me about this dataset is that it includes the GIS coordinates of where the violations are located.  

#### To Investigate:

1. How are various code violations geographically distributed throughout the city?
2. Do some code violations take place more frequently at one time of year than another?
3. Based on different types of violations, what is the difference in time between when a complaint is received and when it is closed?  What does this say about how different sorts of code violations are enforced?
